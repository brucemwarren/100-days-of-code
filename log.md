# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 5 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up account on freecodecamp. Started the process of being accountable. Got ready to do this. 

**Thoughts:** I am looking forward to getting started. New skills for new opportunities.

**Link to work:** None yet....

### Day 1: 6 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through HTML5 and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Now on to Bootstrap. This has been a fantastic idea so far. 

**Thoughts** This is considerably easier to understand with a little Java, Python, SAS, etc. under my belt as well. 

### Day 2: 7 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through Bootstrap section. I'm a fan so far. No real difficulties, but then again it is mostly following directions so far. 

**Thoughts**: Again, this has been a great choice so far. I want to get going on my Python Masterclass as well. I am thinking I will give this through the first project and then poke into that class next. I finished the free version of codecademy Python; very basic, but gave me the flavor at least. 

### Day 3: 8 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Through Bootstrap. Today was tougher.

**Thoughts**: Today was harder than the rest. Mostly, however, it was syntax issues, not concepts. That's at least very fixable. I just need to slow down and make sure it is all correct. That's the lesson for today. 

### Day 4: 9 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: jQuery section is done. Tomorrow begins the real test up to now - projects!!

**Thoughts**: The jQuery section was much easier than Bootstrap. I am familiar with Java, so that might have helped some. But overall I think it is just a matter of being more sure of myself in coding syntax overall. The projects will be where the rubber meets the road, or some other forced metaphor. At the very least, I will have something to commit to Git. 

I did download VS Code as well. I figure it will be helpful in tossing off some other projects that I feel like. Thankfully, I am ahead of the game with school as well. 2018 is under way and well formed so far. 

### Day 5: 10 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: I took a light day today. Made some basic progress on the tribute page. 

**Thoughts**: I wanted to spend a little time with the Mrs. and get a few things done. No regrets. Made a very basic start, just the background, title, and subtitle, but a start still. I did cheat. I wasn't sure how the template made their site look like it did, so I peeked at the code and discovered "jumbotron". I am not even counting that as cheating, really, because I still learned. I could have done the same without that, but I preferred the current look.

### Days 6-8: 11-13 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Last three days have been spent figuring out various things. Nothing really worth its own update, but a lot of reading on col, which I think I get now, and getting set up on the Python end. 

**Thoughts**: Been figuring things out as I go along. I like how FCC gave me the basics, but a lot was left up to me. I can appreciate how some people would be frustrated, but I have managed to use this to learning new things. Definitely a good exercise. Col will be the death of me, still. Python bootcamp will get rolling on Monday, but I want to get the page done first.

### Day 9: 14 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the FCC Tribute Page. Tomorrow I will begin the Python Bootcamp in earnest. 

**Thoughts**: I farted around on it too long, but it's done at this point. I am not completely happy, but it is done and I can move on. I will still come back to it and see about tweaks that I can practice with. Looking forward to getting a little Python in again. I want to get through the basics before I head back into FCC again, to keep it fresh and be able to alternate.

### Day 10: 15 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Python Bootcamp on Udemy; watched lessons on the notebooks and conda.

**Thoughts**: This will follow on the Codecademy free python course I worked through. Hoping to be through the crash course review by the end of this week and start on Numpy over the weekend. I will work on the portfolio page on the side as well, but I want to do some reading on best practices, etc. 

### Day 11: 16 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Python Crash Course Lectures 1 & 2

**Thoughts**: Great review, moving at a good pace. I didn't know before that you can use print("this is {} and this is {}".format(one, two)) and have the same result as print("this is %s and this is %s"(one, two)). Not sure one is better than the other, other than the format allows for defining variables in the {} so order is taken out of the equation. Good tip. Remainder of the crash course and exercises, with luck, tomorrow.
