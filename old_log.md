# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 5 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up account on freecodecamp. Started the process of being accountable. Got ready to do this. 

**Thoughts:** I am looking forward to getting started. New skills for new opportunities.

**Link to work:** None yet....

### Day 1: 6 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through HTML5 and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Now on to Bootstrap. This has been a fantastic idea so far. 

**Thoughts** This is considerably easier to understand with a little Java, Python, SAS, etc. under my belt as well. 

### Day 2: 7 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through Bootstrap section. I'm a fan so far. No real difficulties, but then again it is mostly following directions so far. 

**Thoughts**: Again, this has been a great choice so far. I want to get going on my Python Masterclass as well. I am thinking I will give this through the first project and then poke into that class next. I finished the free version of codecademy Python; very basic, but gave me the flavor at least. 

### Day 3: 8 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Through Bootstrap. Today was tougher.

**Thoughts**: Today was harder than the rest. Mostly, however, it was syntax issues, not concepts. That's at least very fixable. I just need to slow down and make sure it is all correct. That's the lesson for today. 

### Day 4: 9 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: jQuery section is done. Tomorrow begins the real test up to now - projects!!

**Thoughts**: The jQuery section was much easier than Bootstrap. I am familiar with Java, so that might have helped some. But overall I think it is just a matter of being more sure of myself in coding syntax overall. The projects will be where the rubber meets the road, or some other forced metaphor. At the very least, I will have something to commit to Git. 

I did download VS Code as well. I figure it will be helpful in tossing off some other projects that I feel like. Thankfully, I am ahead of the game with school as well. 2018 is under way and well formed so far. 

### Day 5: 10 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: I took a light day today. Made some basic progress on the tribute page. 

**Thoughts**: I wanted to spend a little time with the Mrs. and get a few things done. No regrets. Made a very basic start, just the background, title, and subtitle, but a start still. I did cheat. I wasn't sure how the template made their site look like it did, so I peeked at the code and discovered "jumbotron". I am not even counting that as cheating, really, because I still learned. I could have done the same without that, but I preferred the current look.

### Days 6-8: 11-13 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Last three days have been spent figuring out various things. Nothing really worth its own update, but a lot of reading on col, which I think I get now, and getting set up on the Python end. 

**Thoughts**: Been figuring things out as I go along. I like how FCC gave me the basics, but a lot was left up to me. I can appreciate how some people would be frustrated, but I have managed to use this to learning new things. Definitely a good exercise. Col will be the death of me, still. Python bootcamp will get rolling on Monday, but I want to get the page done first.

### Day 9: 14 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the FCC Tribute Page. Tomorrow I will begin the Python Bootcamp in earnest. 

**Thoughts**: I farted around on it too long, but it's done at this point. I am not completely happy, but it is done and I can move on. I will still come back to it and see about tweaks that I can practice with. Looking forward to getting a little Python in again. I want to get through the basics before I head back into FCC again, to keep it fresh and be able to alternate.

### Day 10: 15 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Python Bootcamp on Udemy; watched lessons on the notebooks and conda.

**Thoughts**: This will follow on the Codecademy free python course I worked through. Hoping to be through the crash course review by the end of this week and start on Numpy over the weekend. I will work on the portfolio page on the side as well, but I want to do some reading on best practices, etc. 

### Day 11: 16 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Python Crash Course lectures 1 & 2

**Thoughts**: Great review, moving at a good pace. I didn't know before that you can use print("this is {} and this is {}".format(one, two)) and have the same result as print("this is %s and this is %s"(one, two)). Not sure one is better than the other, other than the format allows for defining variables in the {} so order is taken out of the equation. Good tip. Remainder of the crash course and exercises, with luck, tomorrow.

### Day 12: 17 January 2018
### Day 13: 19 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Remaining Python Crash Course lectures

**Thoughts**: Not much going on these two days (with a zero day, to borrow a hiking term, in the middle). Just finished the review. Will work on exercises this weekend, around my actual homework. If not by then, then by Monday. I'm not going to stress on this if my actual schoolwork will suffer. I already missed a minor thing and that can't become a habit.

### Day 13, Part Deux

**Additional Progress**: I finished the exercises. This weekend I at least start on NumPy.

### Day 14: 20-22 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Rough framing of the portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have a lot of time this weekend. Some was school, some was kids, but the bottom line is I did about a day's worth of work in the last few. Progress was made on the portfolio; got some tips from Mark Snow's tutorials and some CSS/Bootstrap from searches. So far, so good.

### Day 15: 23 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Through the NumPy lectures in Python Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I really don't mind NumPy or CSS. NumPy seems very useful. Need to go through the exercises next to check my understanding. 

### Day 19: 27 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tightened up the Tribute Page code, worked through NumPy in my bootcamp, and started to finish my portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Worrying less about daily updates. Just been steady work all around on Python and FCC. I am pleased with the tribute page now that I posted it to the FCC board and got some feedback. Rookie mistakes, stuff that should have been in CSS, things like that. Overall, pleased. 

### Day 21: 29 January 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Portfolio for FCC. Starting on Python pandas.

**Thoughts**: Wow. I am beginning to be sort of impressed with myself here. Going really well and I haven't hit a wall quite yet. I'll take it for sure. I need to remember to put my closing tags in right away, however. It is costing me a lot of time when I forget.

### Day 24: 2 February 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started pandas, worked on JavaScript on fcc.

**Thoughts**: I got laid off on Wednesday, so I haven't done a lot. Obviously, this work becomes more important now, along with having more time for it. Always onward.
